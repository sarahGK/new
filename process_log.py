# This file implements the main function to process log file,log.txt to get the first 3 features:
# 1. List in descending order the top 10 most active hosts/IP addresses that have accessed the site.-->hosts.txt
# 2. Identify the top 10 resources(descending order) on the site that consume the most bandwidth. -->resources.txt
# 3. List in descending order the siteâ€™s 10 most frequently visited 60-minute period. -->hours.txt
# Suppost the log.txt was written in the time order.
